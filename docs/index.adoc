= Writing Enonic Guides

This guide walks you through the process of writing a new guide for
inclusion at the https://enonic-guides.github.io[Enonic Guides Site]. These guides can
take different forms—such as short, step-by-step tutorials or longer, more discussion-oriented
pieces—but the process for writing and contributing them is the same.

== What you'll need

- A https://git-scm.org[Git] client (command line is fine, or use one of the many excellent GUI clients)
- A https://github.com[GitHub] account
- A http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java Runtime Environment], version 1.8 or better
- A text editor
